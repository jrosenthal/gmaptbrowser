GMaptBrowser is a relatively simple application designed to supplement browsing interfaces in desktop applications.  Through the use of a Google Maps interface, the user locates the property in question.  Imagery, reverse geocoding, coordinates (Lat/Lon decimal degrees and UTMs in North America), and a link to low angle obliques (Bing Birdseye) are all displayed as the user searches and browses.  Linkages to external applications are accomplished either through COM (in the case of Caliper's Maptitude) or through a simple external bridging script.
